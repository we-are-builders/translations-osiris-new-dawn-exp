"1-1. Physical environment plays a crucial role in survival. Temperature, weather systems, terrain and indigenous life forms all have a direct influence on health and sustainability. Being aware of these elements and the effect that they have is of utmost importance.

1-2. Preventive measures, early recognition, and rapid treatment help minimize the likelihood of decreased functionality and possible death. In short, awareness is key.
",""
"1-3. Gliese 581 is complex and unforgiving of errors. Even in ideal conditions, instances of suit damage, dehydration and indigenous creature attacks may occur. Each instance will require immediate attention and response in order to avoid unfavorable and potentially fatal outcomes. It is wise not to ignore these, as they can become increasingly hazardous to overall health, suit integrity and survival.
",""
"1-4. Equipment has a deterioration factor that varies according to its type and purpose. Time decay and usage plays a part in deterioration, as well as terrain elements. As skill points are acquired, equipment can become more substantial, increasing the life expectancy of each item. However, none of the equipment has an infinite life span. Maintaining proper repair and upkeep of equipment will aid in progress and likelihood of survival.
",""
"1-5. Terrain on extra solar planets can be tretcherous and must be traversed with care. Any misstep can lead to damaging your EVA suit and lead to a suit breach, which can be catastrophic. It's imparitive to explore with extreme caution.

1-6. Slope. When attempting to climb a slope be sure to look at your slope warning indicator. For slopes that are greater than 30 degrees, either at an incline or decline, poses a hazard for your traversal. Attempting to jump or run on this uneven terrain is not advised.

Crouching can be used to traverse extreme slopes if needed.",""
"1-7. Each planet and moon has a unique atmopsheric makeup and will tramatically alter your exploration capabilities.

1-8. Atmopsheric Temperature. The temperature of a world's air and surface is a direct result of its atmopheric density and proximity to its star. Thicker atmopsheres will contain more greenhouse gas effects and create a more stable temperature range (although that temperature may still be extremely cold or hot). Thinner atmopsheres will show a higher range in temperature if the world is not tidally locked to the star, or if so, will ldepend on your geographic location on the world.

1-9. Weather Patterns. There is no telling what you may discover in terms of weather. Your EVA suit was designed to handle known weather situations, but may be suseptible to damage in an extreme situation.

If caught in a Dust Storm, be sure to pay attention to the direction the storm is coming from. Seek shelter however you can to avoid debris from the storm. Crouching can limit the chances of imact by up to 60%.",""

"Suit Maintenance",""
"2-1. The EVA Suit designed for the Osiris Mission is equipped with state-of-the-art sensors. These sensors in turn, provided detailed and up-to-the minute status reports on the viability and integrity of the EVA suit. Monitoring these readings in the HUD are integral to survivability. The sensors monitor: oxygen levels, temperature, hydration/nutrition levels, and health and suit health. 

2-2. Oxygen Levels: Monitoring oxygen consumption is integral. Without oxygen, there is no breathing. Be mindful that running and other taxing activity consume more oxygen. Oxygen will replenish based on traces of O2 in the atmosphere.

2-3. Temperature: Maintaining a viable suit temperature is of the utmost importance. Some climes within the Gliese 581 system will harbor environments that are blistering cold, piercingly hot, and variables in between. If the suit becomes too cold, look for ways to increase the temperature, as hypothermia may ensue. If the suit becomes too hot, look for ways to decrease the temperature, as it may result in death.

2-4. Hydration/Nutrition: Hydration is the outer ring while Nutrition is the inner ring.  Hunger and thirst, if not remedied, can cause a decline in health and performance. Your actions such as running and jumping will impact your thirst and hunger.

2-6. Health/Suit Integrity: Health is the outer ring while Suit Integrity is the inner ring. In instances or severe injuries or suit breaches, Oxygen levels will drop. To fix suit breaches or severe injuries, equip and use bandages, either found or crafted. ",""
"2-7. If the EVA suit becomes damaged or breached during exploration of the Gliese 581 system, make sure to equip and use patch tape to address the breach. Then equip and use bandages to re-stabilize suit integrity. Failure to do so may result in suffocation or possibly death.
",""
"*Use patch tape to repair your EVA suit.",""
"2-8. To ensure optimal EVA performance is achieved, suit maintenance is required when necessary. Patch tape and bandages are required deal with suit breaches. Failure to maintain the suit may result in suffocation or possibly death.

Be sure to mind the environment. Beware of sharp objects as these can pierce your suit and cause a suit breach. Take caution in climbing steep slopes, crouching carefully where possible.",""
"*Use patch tape and bandages for EVA suit repair and maintenance.",""
"*Keep your eye on o2 readings. Be sure to allow your o2 scrubber to replenish while in atmospheres with gases that contain oxygen. NOTE - o2 does not replenish while in space or in very thin atmospheres.",""
"*Zero oxygen will cause suffocation. It is advisable to cease moving until your o2 scrubber can begin to replenish o2 in your EVA suit.",""

"3-1. Quality of life is largely dependent on nutrition, hydration and general health. Over time, physical condition can deteriorate, affecting speed and survival. Hunger and thirst, if not remedied, can cause a decline in health and performance. Climate conditions such as heat and cold also have an effect. It is imperative to monitor these using the suit readings provided.

3-2. When physical condition decreases and health is impaired, healing is possible using certain types of food and bandages. Healing is crucial in order to sustain life.
",""
"3-3. Loss of body water, or dehydration, plays a major role in health and survival. Depending upon level of exertion, hydration needs will fluctuate. Be sure to check hydration levels and consume water whenever the suit reading (located in the lower left-hand corner) indicates the need to do so.
",""
"3-4. Poor nutrition contributes to deterioration in quality of life and chance of survival. Caloric intake is necessary, as well as attention to the types and sources of calories. Almost anything is edible, but not every type of food will heal. Some sources of nutrition will only satisfy the need for calories. Remember to monitor hunger in the suit readings (located in the lower left-hand corner) and replenish calories as needed.

Keeping aware of the outside temperature and suit temperature is vital.  Cold weather injury prevention and timely shelter construction are also critical and may help avoid debilitating injuries. When temperatures drop, be sure to employ methods of creating internal warmth.",""
"4-2. Dehydration happens when your body doesn't have as much water as it needs. Without enough, your body can't function properly. You can have mild, moderate, or severe dehydration depending on how much fluid is missing from your body. Avoid becoming dehydrated by checking the suit reading on hydration level (located in the lower left-hand corner.) Replenish and consume fluids on a regular basis. When temperatures rise due to weather conditions, decreasing internal suit temperature may become necessary to avoid dehydration and even fatality.

Food can be a source of hydration if a Chem Station to create water is not available.",""
"4-3. It is very likely that minor injuries will occur when in combat against indigenous creatures, during missions, or even performing regular tasks. Suit breaches are the most common type of minor injury. If a suit breach occurs, use patch type to repair as soon as is possible.
",""
"*Bandages can heal minor wounds.",""
"*If on a planet with foliage species, attempt to create crude bandages when out of manuafactured bandage reserves.",""
"4-4. In the event a severe injury occurs, immediately find or craft bandages and use them to heal. If this is not done in an expedient manner, health will rapidly deteriorate and death may follow shortly thereafter.

"*Where possible, create large amounts of crude bandages while reserving Medkits for only dire situations.",""
"*Medkits can save your life when experiencing severe wounds.",""
"Navigation",""
"5-1. Navigating through the Gliese 581 System can be both enthralling and frightening. But basic navigation shouldn’t be confusing.

5-2. The Locator provided for the Osiris Mission is an extremely helpful navigational tool. Equipping the locator will reveal the terrain’s topography, names of discovered areas, locations of resources (as indicated by icons), as well as longitude and latitude. Metallic objects will appear on your Locator, as well as your structures.

5-3. Longitude: Longitude is the designated coordinate that identifies the east-west position of a point on the planets terrain. 

5-4. Latitude: Latitude is the designated coordinate that identifies the north-south position of a point on the planets terrain.

"6-1. When exploring and crafting, different tools will be useful in accomplishing various tasks. Tools do not have infinite usage and will wear down over time. It is imperative to repair tools when necessary and/or craft new ones as needed. The rate of decay varies from tool to tool. Some tools will require recipes and specific resources, obtainable only by mining or harvesting them, in order to be crafted. Most tools are only useful for mining, though there are a couple that may be used in combat. These are referred to as hybrid tools.

6-2. Keep in mind that not all tools are able to be obtained right from the start. Some tools will only become available as progress is made and skill points are acquired.",""
"*Chisel can be used to break down minerals.",""
"*Shovel can gather loose materials like sand.",""
"6-3. Artillery can be used to protect against indigenous creatures and human threats.  There are several different types of weapons available for use, not all of them available immediately. Which weapons are initially given depends on chosen class: Marine, Scientist, Ranger, or Engineer. There are two main categories of artillery, Melee and Ranged. Each weapon sustains and gives different levels of damage, depending on ammo and weapon type.",""
"*For ranged weapons be mindful of ammunition reserves.",""
"*Melee weapons take a lot of punishment and frequently need to be repaired.",""
"6-4. Strategy is a key component to surviving Gliese 581 and all that it encompasses. Remaining vigilant at all times and keeping an eye on the horizon is of dire importance. Threats to safety come not only in the form of environmental events, but also indigenous creatures and even other humans. Be prepared. Keep weapons at the ready and fully stocked with ammunition. In some cases, the best tactic is actually fleeing as quickly as possible. Tactics will change on a case by case basis and require critical thinking as well as quick reflexes.",""

Personnel can automatically claim a territory when placing a structure on unclaimed ground. This colony can be joined by other personnel when it has been officially created. Creating a colony can be done by following the steps below:

Click on ‘Create Colony.’
Add other personnel by using the multi tool. Please note that personnel have to belong to the same faction in order to join a colony.

Adding other personnel to an existing colony automatically gives them access to anything that is built or crafted after they joined.
